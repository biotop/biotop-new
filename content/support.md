### Micropayments
We want to keep our website ad-free, yet we believe that you should be able as user of this website to support creators of content directly. Therefore, we support the micropayment system [**flattr**](http://flattr.com) which allows you to send little donations directly to the content-creators. To do so, click on the little icon at the bottom of posts.

### Private Sponsors
We're currently looking for sponsors and sources of funding to fund research projects and setup a space in Villach/Austria. In this process we intend to draw on public funding opportunities, as well as private sponsors, who share our vision and want to support us out of idealism.

Should you be interested in becoming a sponsor, [do get in touch with us via email](mailto:info@biotop.co).

### Equipment Sponsors
In setting up a reasearch lab, the acquisition of lab-equipment is a major contributor to costs.
Since these acquisitions are directly linked to the site in Villach, and enable us to offer workshops and open our lab as a *fablab*, we want to offer sponsorhips linked to individual pieces of equipment as attractive and transparent funding opportunity, especially for local supporters, who will be acknowledged with a plaque locally, as well as online.

Should you be interested in becoming a sponsor, [do get in touch with us via email](mailto:info@biotop.co).
