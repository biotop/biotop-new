Our ["advent calendar"](http://biotop.co/xmascal/) is finally on!

Every day, another aspect of Christmas will be used to explain science and design in an exciting and entertaining way. One will be able to discover what makes snowflakes scientifically exciting, why earworms such as “Last Christmas” drill so deep into our brains, what archaeologists find fascinating about gingerbread, and how architects approach gift-wrapping.

All the content will also be on display in the shop window of our office space at Gerbergasse 3 in Villach. Hopefully see you there!
